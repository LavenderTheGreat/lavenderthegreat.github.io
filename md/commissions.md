I animate these in Blender, so expect high framerate (Typically 12, can be higher!) smooth animations in the style of Pokemon Black/White, where it is done on a skeleton with effects added and slight hints of traditional animation.

As a result, certain complex 3D motions might complicate this or make it hard for me to fulfil your order!

Animation can take a while (Up to 3/4 days of solid work!) but the result can be a lot more high energy and charming, useful for streams, animated icons or just people who want something with a bit more \* *flair* \*.

Animation and pixel art isn't everyone's thing, so I'm offering a traditional option, which is what I've offered previously.

The left is the quality that can be expected while the right is the most recent hi res piece I've done (but its a cleaned up sketch and not rendered).

I can animate these too, and it might be cheaper than a pixel art animation (depending on a few circumstances), I could also animate other images with permission, see below ( **On Custom Requests** ).

## ◆ Notes and Rules ◆

### On The Content Of Requests

Please do not request the following:

- Content designed to offend or target anyone, even people you think 'deserve it'. My art is not for commentary.

- Extreme gore, or content where the main appeal is the gore of it. At best its a rough time for me to draw, at worst it deeply unsettles me, so no.

Please keep in mind that the following may be turned down, but can be done (AKA, please ask, you have nothing to lose!):

- Explicit adult content. Its not my primary focus right now, so unless you have a lot in store for me (money wise) for something real 'out-there' I'll mostly be taking only relatively tame and vanilla requests.

Please do suggest the following! (I'm good at this and/or enjoy it!):

- Lewd but only lightly explicit content!

- Furry content!

- Content with characters with 'thicc' proportions!

<br>

### On Money

- Send funds over Paypal.

- Please refrain from doing a chargeback if we agree on a refund, if by some bizarre reason or some awful shift of events I decide not to refund you without a valid reason (I cannot see this happening, but it felt appropriate to put a back up anyway) then feel free to chargeback because I most certainly deserve it.

- For the meantime, I will not be open to using other services such as Skeb for commissions.

- Money *must* be paid in GBP, Paypal offers functions to convert it your end, please use it!

- You really *really* do not have to include your address, I am pretty sure this is optional. Rumour has it that omitting the address implies that its a digital transaction.

<br>

### On Custom Requests

- If I don't have a specific format listed here, ask about it and I'll see what I can do! I won't charge you a premium for it. Below are some suggestions:

    - Animating others art (with permission)

    - Animated high res art

    - Static pixel art

    - Sketches

<br>

### On High Complexity

- If your character or request looks extremely complex, I'll approach you about any additional fees that may happen (due to the time it'll take to draw your character!)

    - You probably won't come across this unless you've got something like Obelisk The Tormentor from 'Yu-Gi-Oh!'. So it shouldn't be a concern.

I hope you enjoy doing business with me~!
